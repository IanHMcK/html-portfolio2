<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a retired Electricasl Engineer, just retired from an 11 year stint in Kazakhstan.
  I needed something to keep the grey matter ticking over so enrolled on a web development course.
  It really does keep the mind active.

<p>My hobbies include blacksmithing and wood turning, both of which come in handy on our smallholding.</p>
